# TinyStore_XamarinForms
This is a test application I made during a Xamarin Forms (and other stuff) crash course.

Here You'll find :
* Mvvm and Binding
* Basic handling of Events and Commands
* Basic usage of the stock Http client
* Basic persistence using Realm
* other stuff like (basic) styling and so on
Dummy data is provided by getsandbox.com (please use your own sandbox, I only have a basic plan)

Many Thanks to Alessio Fedi (the teacher)!
